title: "Example"
execute:
  eval: false

This file shouldn't be linted as set eval to False in document YAML.

```{python}
very_long_line = "This long string exceeds the maximum allowed characters per line."
```

However, this file should, as have overridden with eval True in the chunk options.

```{python}
#| eval: true
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

add_numbers(3, 5)

import sys
```
